# Customer Segmentation Analysis Using PySpark

## Project Overview
The Business-to-Consumer (B2C) online retail sector is inherently competitive, with companies heavily investing in acquiring new customers while prioritizing customer loyalty and profitability to grow market share.

In this environment, understanding why customers leave is critical. Companies are increasingly focusing on strategies to reduce customer churn and identify high-value customers. According to Renjith (2015), the churn rate is the percentage of customers who leave a firm within a specific time period.

One of the most effective ways to retain customers is by identifying potential churn early and acting quickly to prevent it. Detecting early signs of churn, understanding customer needs based on their behavior, and automating personalized win-back campaigns are essential strategies for sustaining business in today’s competitive landscape (Neslin et al., 2006).

This project aims to analyze the likelihood of customer attrition in the online retail market using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis. RFM is a proven marketing model for customer segmentation based on transaction history—how recently, how often, and how much a customer has spent.

By assigning scores to each customer, this analysis helps predict those at risk of churning, while also exploring various related questions.
